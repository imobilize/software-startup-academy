        <h2><b style="font-size: 1em; font-family: Proxima-Regular, sans-serif;">General</b></h2>

        <p><b>Sale of Goods.</b></p>
        <p><span class="text-normal">The Website may from time to time offer the sale of
                tangible products (“goods”) to you. We will arrange for shipment of goods to you. Please check the
                individual product page for specific delivery options. You will pay all shipping and handling charges
                specified during the ordering process. Shipping and handling charges are a reimbursement for the costs we
                incur in the processing, handling, packing, shipping, and delivery of your order. Title and risk of loss
                pass to you upon our transfer of the goods to the shipping carrier. Shipping and delivery dates are
                estimates only and cannot be guaranteed. We are not liable for any delays in shipments. Unless a return
                policy for goods is posted on the Website at the time of your purchase, the sale of all goods on the Website
                is final and non-returnable. However, to the extent a return policy is posted on the Website at the time of
                your purchase, we will accept a return of any goods pursuant to such return policy. To return goods, you
                must email us at&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:support@andrebarrett.com"><span
                    class="text-normal">support@andrebarrett.com</span></a><span class="text-normal">&nbsp;before
                shipping your goods. No returns of any type will be accepted without first emailing us as specified above.
                You are responsible for all shipping and handling charges on returned goods. You bear the risk of loss
                during shipment. Your refund will be credited back to the same payment method used to make the original
                purchase on the Website. If you can show that a good shipped by us was in defective condition before being
                given over to the carrier for shipment to you, we will accept a return of the defective good and provide a
                replacement to you if available (or refund your purchase price if no replacement is available).&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p><b>Sale of Subscription/Membership Services</b></p>
        <p><span class="text-normal">The Website may from time to time offer optional subscription services (or
                subscription membership programs) for specified users (“Subscription Services”). By selecting a Subscription
                Service, you agree to pay us the subscription or usage fees indicated for that service on the Website.
                Payments for subscription services will be charged on the day your Subscription Service goes into effect and
                will cover the use of that service for the period indicated. Thereafter, you agree that monthly payments (or
                other periodic payments as specified on the Website at the time of purchase) will continue to be charged to
                your credit card on a recurring basis until you cancel your Subscription Service. The amount of the
                recurring charge will be the then-current subscription fee applicable to the Subscription Service you
                selected. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may increase if the applicable
                subscription fee increases. Subscription Services must be cancelled in writing (by email to&nbsp;</span><a
                href="mailto:support@andrebarrett.com"><span
                    class="text-normal">support@andrebarrett.com</span></a><span class="text-normal">) at least
                thirty (30) days prior to your next recurring payment in order to avoid billing of the next Subscription
                Service recurring payment. Subscription Service fees are not prorated or refundable, unless expressly stated
                otherwise on the Website. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we reserve the right to
                either suspend or terminate your Subscription Services. Any such suspension or termination will result in
                the cancellation of any promotional programs applicable to your Subscription Services. You agree to submit
                any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing (at the email address above) to us within sixty
                (60) days after such charge, otherwise such dispute is waived by you and such charge will be final and not
                subject to challenge.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><b>Order Acceptance and Cancellation.</b></p>
        <p><span class="text-normal">You agree that your order is an
                offer to buy all products and services listed in your order. All orders must be accepted by us or we will
                not be obligated to sell the products or services to you. We may choose not to accept orders at our sole
                discretion, even after we send you a confirmation email with your order information and details of the items
                you have ordered.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><b>Prices and Payment Terms.</b></p>
        <p><span class="text-normal">All prices, discounts, and promotions
                posted on this Website are subject to change without notice. The price charged for a product or service will
                be the price in effect at the time the order is placed and may be set out in your order confirmation email.
                Subject to our right to increase the cost of subscription-based services (as noted in the Section entitled
                “Sale of Subscription Services” above), price increases will only apply to orders placed after such changes.
                Posted prices do not include taxes or charges for shipping and handling. All such taxes and charges (if
                applicable) will be added to your purchase total, and will be itemized in your shopping cart and in your
                order confirmation email. We strive to display accurate price information, however we may, on occasion, make
                inadvertent typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions related to pricing and availability. We reserve
                the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time and to cancel any orders arising
                from such occurrences. We may offer from time to time promotions on the Website that may affect pricing and
                that are governed by terms and conditions separate from these Terms of Sale. If there is a conflict between
                the terms for a promotion and these Terms of Sale, the promotion terms will govern. Terms of payment are
                within our sole discretion, and payment must be received by us in the manner specified on the Website before
                our acceptance of an order. If using a credit card, you represent and warrant that (i) the credit card
                information you supply to us is true, correct and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit
                card for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iv)
                you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including shipping and handling charges and all
                applicable taxes, if applicable, regardless of the amount quoted on the Website at the time of your
                order.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p><b>Refunds and Chargebacks</b></p>
        <p><span class="text-normal">Once a product has been purchased by you, no right of cancellation or refund exists under the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 due to the electronic nature of our products.
                         Any refunds shall be at our sole and absolute discretion.
                         You agree that under no circumstances whatsoever shall you initiate any chargebacks via your payment provider.
                          You agree that any payments made by you for any of our products are final and may not be charged back.
                           We reserve the right to alter any of our prices from time to time.</span></p>

                                   Furthermore, we shall not be liable to you or any party for consequential, indirect, special or exemplary damages including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, business or anticipated benefits whether arising under tort, contract, negligence or otherwise whether or not foreseen, reasonably foreseeable or advised of the possibility of such damages.</span></p>

    <p><span class="text-normal">You acknowledge that COMPANY has the right but not the obligation to use and
            display any postings or contributions of any kind and that COMPANY may elect to cease the use and display of
            any such materials (or any portion thereof), at any time for any reason whatsoever. </span></p>

            <p><b>Termination</b></p>
        <p><span class="text-normal">We may cancel or terminate your right to use the Site or any part of the Site at
                any time without notice. In the event of cancellation or termination, you are no longer authorized to access
                the part of the Site affected by such cancellation or termination. The restrictions imposed on you with
                respect to material downloaded from the Site, and the disclaimers and limitations of liabilities set forth

    <p><b>Limitations on Linking and Framing.</b></p>
