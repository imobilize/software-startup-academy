          No matter what your passion, hobby, or skill is… Software Bootcamp will give you a simple guide to get your
          software business up and running fast and turn your software development skills into a profitable side-hustle
          by doing something you actually enjoy.

          <p>
            Successful software developers are not the ones you work with. Let's face it. They argue about which
            software design pattern to use, they complain about how the codebase needs refactoring and that the current
            architecture isn't clean enough. They want SOLID principles through the code base but forget what really
            counts. Having a SOLID bank account that allows you to enjoy life. Successful developers make money online
            and then travel the world without worrying about paying the bills or where their next pay check is coming from.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Using the Startup Bootcamp, you’ll be able to create a super easy side-hustle that only takes a few hours a
            week to work on. Or if you so choose, you can spend a little more time on it and turn it into your own
            profit generating asset!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Whether you have just landed your first graduate role in software development, or are someone who has a ton of
            experience coding, or if you’re someone who hasn't written a line of code yet but you are able to think
            logically…
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Startup Bootcamp will give you insight into what’s working NOW to get an online business up and running fast
            and get handsomely rewarded by using your development skills!

          Here’s A Weird But True Fact:
          People Who Are Less Adept At Software Development, Actually Find It Easier To Make Money Online! </h3>

        <p>
          The best way to find success making money online is not to focus on your coding. You have this skillset down
          already! Instead you need to focus on the thing that matters the most. Marketing!
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
            It doesn't matter if you know nothing about marketing or making money. You didn't know the first thing about
            coding when you started right? But look how far you've come </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            You probably know a person or you’ve heard of a person who may not be the best software developer but they
            have made a ton of money online. Heck just go to Youtube. You'll see dozens of young kids that have become
            super successful. Why is that? </p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            No, it’s simply because they tried. They didn't let the fear of not knowing what to do or not having the
            correct skillset to make it work hold them back. They just wanted to achive something so they put effort
            into it.</p>
          <p>
            However, they didn't have software development skills so they focused on the one activity that they could: Connecting with people through engaging content. And what happend as a consequence? Their social media accounts gained loads of followers, their Youtube channel got lots of views and they started making money online.

        <div>
          <p>
            Marketing is by far the most important part of your business. You can have a product but without good marketing you would struggle to sell. However, if you are great at marketing, you don't even need your own product. 
            You could actually make money selling other people's product. 
            Why do you think all those Youtubers are making a killing? They sell adverting for Youtube, they do product placements, sponsored videos etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also ways to market and sell without even having the product ready. Take Apple for example, how many Apple watches did they sell before they began manufacturing the damn things? Apple is a marketing machine! Don't get me wrong their products are great too, but even Steve Jobs knew the importance of great marketing and now tons of companies try to emulate how they do it. </p>

          Is Startup Bootcamp For You?

        <div class="entry-content rlcm">
          <p>The Startup Bootcamp program isn’t for everyone. Personally, I would rather share my knowledge with a small
            group of hard-working action takers than a bunch of people on the lookout for a “magic button” that will
            make them instantly successful.</p>
          <p><strong>Startup Bootcamp Is Not For You If…</strong></p>
          <ul class="cross-o mb-4">
            <li>You’re looking for a “magical success button” that will instantly bring a million dollars…without
              putting in the work (spoiler alert: that button doesn’t exist). Yes, this course will hand you a roadmap
              that will save you countless hours of trial and error. But you need to be willing to put in the work.</li>
            <li>You’re not willing to make changes or listen to advice. The Startup Bootcamp system is very
              different than most other approaches you’ve probably seen before. So it’s important that you come in with
              an open mind.</li>
            <li>You sell get-rich-quick schemes. If you’re in that space stop reading and unsubscribe from my list. I
              have no interest in helping you.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Startup Bootcamp Is For You If…</strong></p>
          <ul class="tick-o">
            <li>You are thinking of starting a business and you know it's smarter to get some training to prevent you from messing up and wasting time.</li>
            <li>You want to know how to use your software development skills to build a product that people will enjoy and use. A product that will also allow you to make enough money for you to enjoy a safe and secure lifestyle.</li>
            <li>You have a business already and you are thinking of using software (whether that's an app or a website) to generate you another recurring income stream.</li>
            <li>You’re someone with a “bias towards action” that implements what they learn.</li>
            <li>You understand that, while results can certainly come fast, creating a growing, successful, tech
              business takes work.</li>

        <h3>My $150,000 Dollar Startup Lesson</h3>
        <p class="center-subtitle">Let me share my personal story with you. Before I developed the Startup Bootcamp, I failed miserably as an
          entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>I had never been taught business at school and was never really that interested in making money. I just
          wanted to work on cool software projects that were interesting.

        <p>I was, however, inspired by some of the famous software developers such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk that
          had created something the world wanted and used.</p>
        <p>So I set out to build something I thought the world needed. An events platform that would change how we
          discover and engage with up-coming events. Think of Eventbrite crossed with Instagram and you will be close
          to what I had in mind.</p>

        <p>You can see some screenshots of the app below. For no other reason than I thought it was a cool name, I
          called the website and app Onit. To this day I still cringe even just saying the name ...</p>

        <p>I wasn't alone in this endeavor. I hired some inexperienced software developers and personally mentored and
          trained them. In doing so I discovered I had a real talent for teaching and making things easy to understand.
          They eventually became great software engineers.</p>

        <h3>My First Major Product Launch Was A Disaster!</h3>
        <p>The sofware worked well. Both website and app had a great user interface, nicely designed and was simple to
          use. Being one of the best software developers in the UK I expected nothing less. <b>The problem was, no one
            wanted to use it!</b></p>

        <p>I had made three of the biggest mistakes a Startup could make.
          <li>Firstly I had designed and developed something for myself assuming that lots of other people would want it
            too. </li>
          <li>Secondly I had not tested the market to see if there was a demand.</li>
          <li>Third, I knew nothing about marketing.</li>

        </p>
        <p>I had spent so much time focusing on becoming the best software engineer I could that it never occured to me
          that I needed to learn anything about marketing.</p>
        <p>I had the "if you build it they will come" mentality. If I ever find the person that made me believe this
          nonsense I will beat him to a pulp!</p>
        <p>Up until now <b>I had spent over $150,000 dollars on developing this software!</b> Most of this money was
          spent on paying employees but I had also been renting office space, buying computer and office equipment,
          paying utility bills, paying accountancy fees and even local area office tax.</p>
        <p>With no one using the app or website there was literally no way to recoup this money!</p>

        <p>One product is a fitness app called <b>Fit In 5</b> that myself and my business partner Marvin launched
          together. It gives you fitness exercises in bitesize 5 min routines so that even if you are limited on time,
          you can still get a workout.

          <p>Plus, I’ll also share the advanced tactics and techniques that can help scale your business to

          How Startup Bootcamp Works
        </h2>

        <p>Startup Bootcamp is my step-by-step system for planning, creating, launching and scaling profitable
          tech businesses.</p>

          <br>
          
          <figure class="entry-thumbnail mb-0" style="background-color: #fff">

          </figure>
        <br>

        <p>You’ll get video lessons, accompanied by templates, examples, and other step-by-step
          instructions that show you exactly what to do and how to do it.</p>

          <figure class="entry-thumbnail mb-0" style="background-color: #fff">

          </figure>

      <br>

        <p>Wondering if your business idea is going to work? I show you the exact process that I use to determine if a business idea has any merit.</p>
        <p>Don’t have a business idea yet? You get given a formula that will help you generate — and refine — your
          idea.</p>
        <p>Not sure how to go about developing a product? I reveal how to develop a product for launch which you can do on a smaller budget.</p>
        <p>In short: when you invest in Startup Bootcamp, you get access to a system that shows you the most important fundamentals of 
          a successful tech startup.</p>
        <p>To create the material in Startup Bootcamp, I broke down the most crucial aspects of creating a profitable tech startup including
          generating startup ideas, researching ideas, validating the idea, market testing, designing the business around the idea, running the business, and more.</p>
        <p>And finally, I pull together what works, and distill it all into a repeatable, step-by-step blueprint.
        </p>
        <p>Let me walk you through everything you’ll learn inside the core Startup Bootcamp training…</p>

          Frequently Asked Questions About Startup Bootcamp
        </h3>
        <div class="entry-content rlcm">
          <p>Have a question about Startup Bootcamp? I answer the most common questions below. And if you have
            a question that I didn’t cover, feel free to contact our support team at <a
              href="mailto:support@andrebarrett.com">support@andrebarrett.com</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “What is Startup Bootcamp, and how does it work?”</strong></p>
          <p>Startup Bootcamp is an on demand training program that walks you through exactly how to start and
            grow a tech business in record time. I've added all the lesson videos, templates, resources and bonus tips that’s designed to help
            you start a tech business from scratch.</p>
          <p>You have lifetime access to all of the training material, so you can either go through the content all in one go, or you can slow things down and go at your own pace. It’s totally up to you.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “Is the training live? Or do I need to show up at a particular time?”</strong></p>
          <p>You do not need to show up anywhere live. I designed the Startup Bootcamp program so that you can
            go completely at your own pace. So if you are busy for long periods of time — because you’re going on vacation or
            have a lot going on right now — you won’t miss anything.</p>
          <p>100% of the course materials are pre-recorded and available in your member’s area anytime you want to
            access them. And because you have lifetime access to the course materials, you can go at your own pace (or
            review any part of the course again).</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “This isn’t a great time for me. I’m really busy…”</strong></p>
          <p>Startup Bootcamp is built for busy individuals. The course is focused and effective. It's broken down into bitesize chunks each one packed with important concepts. In other words, Startup Bootcamp will save you countless hours
            trying to figure out things on your own.</p>
          <p>Plus, with video and downloadable templates included, you can review the material on your own terms.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “How long does the course take to complete?”</strong></p>
          <p>The course is designed to take about 4 weeks to complete. Each video is short and focused. I recommend
            watching one per day, and with lifetime access you can revisit them whenever you like.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “When do I get access to the course?”</strong></p>
          <p>As soon as you join, you’ll get instant access to the course and all the materials through the members portal.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “What makes Startup Bootcamp different?”</strong></p>
          <p>Have you ever been through the process of trying to join a Startup Accelerator program? I know I have. And it’s super frustrating!</p>
           <p>
            If you have ever been rejected you were probably left wondering why? Was my idea not good enough? Was it me personally they didn't like? This course gives you the same level of acceleration without having to deal with all the hassle of applying and being rejected. It allows you to start a business on your own terms.</p>
            <p>And if you then decide you do want to apply to an accelerator, you'll be much better prepared and miles ahead of your competition</p>
  
          <p><strong>Q: “Andre, just tell me: is Startup Bootcamp right for me?”</strong></p>
          <p>When I put together this course, I had three types of people in mind:</p>
          <p><strong>Person #1:</strong> You want to start a business around a tech idea. Maybe you are a software developer and you know how to write the code for it. You’ve never started a business before and need a guide to know what to do. Or maybe you have some business knowledge and have access to a team of developers but you are unsure about how to get started. Either way,
            the detailed blueprint that you get access to in Startup Bootcamp will show you how to get your
            tech startup business off the ground in record time.</p>
          <p><strong>Person #2:</strong> You want to use a mobile app or a website to add a revenue stream to your existing business. You
            already have a business that’s going well. And you see an opportunity that an app or website could bring in
            the form of a new revenue stream for your existing business. This is exactly how I started. Which is why I
            designed the course to work for folks that want to add tech to their existing business.</p>
          <p><strong>Person #3:</strong> You already have a tech product launched but you are not sure how to monetise it to make it profitable. Maybe your tech product is on the right track. But you know there’s a lot more potential for
            growth. Or maybe you feel like your idea is great… but not as many people are buying as you had hoped.
            Either way, I’ve got you covered. The advanced techniques and strategies that you’ll only find in Startup Bootcamp will help take your business idea to the next level.</p>
