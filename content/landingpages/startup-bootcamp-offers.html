          <p>I’ve developed this system over several years after making tons of fatal startup mistakes and watched many others do the same. And I’ve
            refined my approach over the past few years so that I'll never make the same mistakes again.</p>
          <p>Plus, I’ll also share the advanced tactics and techniques that can help scale your business to
            6-figures and beyond.</p>
          <p>You’ll never have to wonder “what do I do next?” because you’ll have a step-by-step blueprint for creating a

          How Startup Bootcamp Works
        </h2>

        <p>Startup Bootcamp is my step-by-step system for planning, creating, launching and scaling profitable
          tech businesses.</p>

          <br>
          
          <figure class="entry-thumbnail mb-0" style="background-color: #fff">

          </figure>
        <br>

        <p>You’ll get video lessons, accompanied by templates, examples, and other step-by-step
          instructions that show you exactly what to do and how to do it.</p>

          <figure class="entry-thumbnail mb-0" style="background-color: #fff">

          </figure>

      <br>

        <p>Wondering if your business idea is going to work? I show you the exact process that I use to determine if a business idea has any merit.</p>
        <p>Don’t have a business idea yet? You get given a formula that will help you generate — and refine — your
          idea.</p>
        <p>Not sure how to go about developing a product? I reveal how to develop a product for launch which you can do on a smaller budget.</p>
        <p>In short: when you invest in Startup Bootcamp, you get access to a system that shows you the most important fundamentals of 
          a successful tech startup.</p>
        <p>To create the material in Startup Bootcamp, I broke down the most crucial aspects of creating a profitable tech startup including
          generating startup ideas, researching ideas, validating the idea, market testing, designing the business around the idea, running the business, and more.</p>
        <p>And finally, I pull together what works, and distill it all into a repeatable, step-by-step blueprint.
        </p>
        <p>Let me walk you through everything you’ll learn inside the core Startup Bootcamp training…</p>

          Frequently Asked Questions About Startup Bootcamp
        </h3>
        <div class="entry-content rlcm">
          <p>Have a question about Startup Bootcamp? I answer the most common questions below. And if you have
            a question that I didn’t cover, feel free to contact our support team at <a
              href="mailto:admin@imobilize.co.uk">admin@imobilize.co.uk</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “What is Startup Bootcamp, and how does it work?”</strong></p>
          <p>Startup Bootcamp is an on demand training program that walks you through exactly how to start and
            grow a tech business in record time. I've added all the lesson videos, templates, resources and bonus tips that’s designed to help
            you start a tech business from scratch.</p>
          <p>You have lifetime access to all of the training material, so you can either go through the content all in one go, or you can slow things down and go at your own pace. It’s totally up to you.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “Is the training live? Or do I need to show up at a particular time?”</strong></p>
          <p>You do not need to show up anywhere live. I designed the Startup Bootcamp program so that you can
            go completely at your own pace. So if you are busy for long periods of time — because you’re going on vacation or
            have a lot going on right now — you won’t miss anything.</p>
          <p>100% of the course materials are pre-recorded and available in your member’s area anytime you want to
            access them. And because you have lifetime access to the course materials, you can go at your own pace (or
            review any part of the course again).</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “This isn’t a great time for me. I’m really busy…”</strong></p>
          <p>Startup Bootcamp is built for busy individuals. The course is focused and effective. It's broken down into bitesize chunks each one packed with important concepts. In other words, Startup Bootcamp will save you countless hours
            trying to figure out things on your own.</p>
          <p>Plus, with video and downloadable templates included, you can review the material on your own terms.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “How long does the course take to complete?”</strong></p>
          <p>The course is designed to take about 4 weeks to complete. Each video is short and focused. I recommend
            watching one per day, and with lifetime access you can revisit them whenever you like.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “When do I get access to the course?”</strong></p>
          <p>As soon as you join, you’ll get instant access to the course and all the materials through the Software Startup Academy members portal.</p>
          <p><strong>Q: “What makes Startup Bootcamp different?”</strong></p>
          <p>Have you ever been through the process of trying to join a Startup Accelerator program? I know I have. And it’s super frustrating!</p>
           <p>
            If you have ever been rejected you were probably left wondering why? Was my idea not good enough? Was it me personally they didn't like? This course gives you the same level of acceleration without having to deal with all the hassle of applying and being rejected. It allows you to start a business on your own terms.</p>
            <p>And if you then decide you do want to apply to an accelerator, you'll be much better prepared and miles ahead of your competition</p>
  
          <p><strong>Q: “Andre, just tell me: is Startup Bootcamp right for me?”</strong></p>
          <p>When I put together this course, I had three types of people in mind:</p>
          <p><strong>Person #1:</strong> You want to start a business around a tech idea. Maybe you are a software developer and you know how to write the code for it. You’ve never started a business before and need a guide to know what to do. Or maybe you have some business knowledge and have access to a team of developers but you are unsure about how to get started. Either way,
            the detailed blueprint that you get access to in Startup Bootcamp will show you how to get your
            tech startup business off the ground in record time.</p>
          <p><strong>Person #2:</strong> You want to use a mobile app or a website to add a revenue stream to your existing business. You
            already have a business that’s going well. And you see an opportunity that an app or website could bring in
            the form of a new revenue stream for your existing business. This is exactly how I started. Which is why I
            designed the course to work for folks that want to add tech to their existing business.</p>
          <p><strong>Person #3:</strong> You already have a tech product launched but you are not sure how to monetise it to make it profitable. Maybe your tech product is on the right track. But you know there’s a lot more potential for
            growth. Or maybe you feel like your idea is great… but not as many people are buying as you had hoped.
            Either way, I’ve got you covered. The advanced techniques and strategies that you’ll only find in Startup Bootcamp will help take your business idea to the next level.</p>
