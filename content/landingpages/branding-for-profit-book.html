                <p>If you watched my video on this page, you saw that I didn’t have the benefit of a business education growing up, and I didn’t have family or friends who were successful either. I had to figure this all out for myself.</p>
                <p>I tried a lot of different business ideas, most of which didn’t work out. Because I kept persevering, I eventually figured out the formula for success.</p>
                <p>I’ve been very fortunate now to have started many businesses that reached the million dollar sales level (and some of my businesses have reached much higher).</p>
                <p>In the process, I’ve had wonderful opportunity to meet, interview, and get to know some of the icons of business success. I’ve been featured in books myself, and asked to teach around the world.</p>

                <h1 class="text-center" style="">This Realization <br>Changed Everything</h1>
                <p>As I mentioned in the video, a few years ago I had a major realization.</p>
                <p>I was thinking about the hundreds of successful entrepreneurs, millionaires and billionaires that I’ve known and interviewed now… and I realized that they all had something in common.</p>
                <p>The more I thought about it, the more I couldn’t STOP thinking about it. Somehow, it made everything make sense.</p>
                <p><strong>Successful people are better at finding and creating opportunity, and better at making decisions about which opportunities to bet on.</strong></p>
                <p>This is the difference that puts successful people on another level!</p>
                <p>If you look at the successful people you know, who are consistently successful in business, investing, with money, and in their financial lives — those who win not only in the short-run, but also in the long-run — you’ll see what I’m talking about.</p>
                <p>These are the people who are constantly finding and creating great opportunities, then choosing the best ones to bet on.</p>

                <p>To be successful, you have to be good at <strong>discovering</strong> and <strong>developing</strong> opportunities! </p>
                <p><img src="./Get Your Free Copy Of My New Book OPPORTUNITY While They Last_files/discovering-opportunities.jpg" alt=""></p>
                <p>In my own work and life, I have designed and collected a set of powerful tools for discovering and developing opportunity in the key areas of business, money, and investments, but also in other areas of my life as well. </p>
                <p>When I realized how important opportunity was to success, I started writing them all down, to see what I had, and quickly I had dozens of pages.</p>
                <p>In the process of my initial work, I also discovered that researchers have also been studying opportunity lately. It’s actually become a science, without anyone realizing it!</p>
                <p>I started asking my friends, who are great entrepreneurs, about opportunity, and I realized that no one in my circle had taken on studying opportunity as a subject all by itself… to learn its nature, how it works, and how it changes over time… to find the universal patterns in all domains. </p>
                <p>And I realized that the opportunity, was to study opportunity itself.</p>

                <p>It quickly became obvious that I needed to put these ideas into a book. And after over a year of hard work on it, I’ve got something that I’m really proud to share with you. </p>
                <p>The book is called “Opportunity” and finally, in one place, you have a resource that shows you what opportunity is, how it works, how it’s changing, and how to get more of it in your life.</p>
                <p>I’ve spent thousands of hours studying opportunity, and hundreds of hours now writing about it. I have organized what I believe to be the art, the science, and the psychology of opportunity, and carefully condensed it down into this book that you can read in a few hours. </p>
                <p>If you’re interested in getting and creating more opportunity, and building your life so that more and more opportunity comes to you, then start here. Just click below, enter you name and email, and then tell me where to send your free copy of Opportunity, and your bonuses. </p>
                <p>This will open so many doors for you, and get you on the path to a lot more opportunity!</p>

                <h1 class="text-center" style="">What’s Inside The Book?</h1>
                <p>First of all, there is an explosion of opportunity around the world right now. As I talk to my entrepreneur friends, we are all astonished at the opportunities that are coming from everywhere, fueled by the rise of the internet.</p>
                <p>In Opportunity, you’ll learn the mindsets, tools, and mental models to not only see opportunity, but also to create more of it, and to take advantage of it to create the life that you want.</p>
                <p>The key here is the mindset shift that this book will install. It’s a new lens that clarifies and helps you see the opportunities that are emerging all around is. </p>
                <p>Once you have this new mindset, you literally start seeing opportunities everywhere.</p>
                <p><strong>In Opportunity, you’ll learn: </strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What opportunity is, how it works, and where to find it</li>
                    <li>How to overcome “opportunity shock” and avoid the paralysis that can come with having too many options</li>
                    <li>How your emotional state influences your ability to take advantage of opportunity, and how to optimize your state to attract and capitalize on opportunity across different domains of your life</li>
                    <li>How to overcome fear of failure, so you can get more of what you want in your life</li>
                    <li>What mental models are, and how to use them for estimating the value of an opportunity, comparing opportunities to each other, and choosing those most likely to bring you success and fulfillment</li>
                    <li>How to find more opportunities in business, money, investing, health, happiness, relationships, and personal development</li>
                    <li>Why collaborating with others multiplies your power to find and develop opportunities</li>
                    <li>How to become an innovator and a thought leader in order to help others discover their own biggest opportunities</li>
                    <li>The way to discover your greatest personal opportunity in life</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I’ve designed this book to help you create a “future-proof life”, where you become more and more confident in the future that’s emerging, because you’re using your talents to create value for other people in a unique way.</p>
                <p>And during our launch, I’m going to buy you a copy and send it to you as a gift. All I ask is that you cover the shipping and handling.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Again, the book and bonuses are a gift from me, you just pay the shipping and handling of $6.97 if you’re in the USA (only $12.97 for international)... </p>
                <p>When you order you’ll get the three bonuses listed above ($197 value), plus some additional “surprise bonuses”... to help you get results and really use what you learn in the book.</p>
                <p>By the way, I just showed this book to a major publisher, and within hours was offered a book deal for it. I was planning to just self-publish it, but now it looks like I’m going to be publishing it internationally as well, which is cool.</p>
                <p>Before I do that, I’m launching it myself, and offering it to buy you a copy. All you have to cover is the shipping and handling. But I do have a <strong>limited supply of books</strong>, so grab your copy before they’re all gone!</p>
                <p>OPPORTUNITY is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to use. After your first twenty minutes or so with it, you’ll “get it”, and you’ll be hooked. But most importantly, what you learn will change the way that you see things, and you won’t be able to go back.</p>
                <p>I’m very fascinated with what you might call “quality of knowledge.” Some knowledge is a lot more valuable than other knowledge, and some books are a lot more valuable than others. I wrote this book over the past year, and kept tweaking and tuning it until it was super-condensed, and super easy to understand.</p>
                <p>This is the highest quality book that you will read this year. There’s more knowledge per page than anything I know of, and it contains an idea that will actually change your life.</p>
