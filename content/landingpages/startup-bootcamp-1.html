          No matter what your passion, hobby, or skill is… Software Bootcamp will give you a simple guide to get your
          software business up and running fast and turn your software development skills into a profitable side-hustle
          by doing something you actually enjoy.

            Successful software developers are not the ones you work with. Let's face it. They argue about which
            software design pattern to use, they complain about how the codebase needs refactoring and that the current
            architecture isn't clean enough. They want SOLID principles through the code base but forget what really
            counts. Having a SOLID bank account that allows you to enjoy life. Successful developers make money online
            and then travel the world without worrying about paying the bills or where their next paycheck is going to
            come from.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Using the Startup Bootcamp, you’ll be able to create a super easy side-hustle that only takes a few hours a
            week to work on. Or if you so choose, you can spend a little more time on it and turn it into your own
            profit generating asset!

            Whether you have just landed your first graduate role in software development, or someone who has a ton of
            experience coding, or if you’re someone who hasn't written a line of code yet but you are able to think
            logically…

          The best way to find success making money online is not to focus on your coding. You have this skillset down
          already! Instead you need to focus on the thing that matters the most. Marketing!
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
            It doesn't matter if you know nothing about marketing or making money. You didn't know the first thing about
            coding when you first started right? But look how far you've come </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            You probably know a person or you’ve heard of a person who may not be the best software developer but they
            have made a ton of money online. Heck just go to Youtube. You'll see dozens of young kids that have becomes
            super successful. Why is that? </p>

            No, it’s simply because they tried. They didn't let the fear of not knowing what to do or not having the
            correct skillset to make it work hold them back. They just wanted to achive something so they put effort

            You see our world is built on connection. It's a necessity to connect for survival, for friendship, for
            love, for growth and to make money. But as software developers we tend to feel more comfortable being
            introverted. We are afraid to put ourselves out there. We hold ourselves back. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Here is what Mark Zuckerberg had to say about connection.

      <div class="col-6">
        <strong>
          “When I was building Facebook I was just trying to help connect people… you couldn’t find and connect with the
          people that you cared about, which as people is actually the most important thing.”
        </strong>

      <div class="col-10">
        <p>
          <br />
          Connecting with people is how we offer our products and services. They value and want our services. But we
          need to connect with them to deliver and in return get paid. This is all marketing really is. <b>Marketing is the science of connecting with people</b>.

        <h3>Why it is so easy to make money online</h3>
        <p>Which leads me to an important truth …</p>

        <p>The better you are at connecting with people and attracting them to check out your services and digital
          products, the
          more successful you’ll be.</p>
        <p>And the good news is, compared to the complex problems you solve on a daily basis as a software engineer,
          this is easy!</p>
        <p>Just imagine for a second what it would mean for you if hundreds or even thousands or even tens of thousands
          of people from around the world see and buy your products and services. You’d have a much greater impact.</p>
        <p>Your income would skyrocket.</p>
        <p>And you’d have the beginnings of a VERY successful online business.</p>
        <p>In fact, once people start buying your product, they’ll likely want you to create even MORE products (and
          oftentimes they’ll email you and tell you what they want!).</p>

        <h3>My $150,000 Dollar Startup Lesson</h3>
        <p class="center-subtitle">Before I developed the Startup Bootcamp, I used to really struggle as an
          entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>I had never been taught business at school and was never really that interested in making money. I just
          wanted to work on cool software projects that were interesting.

          <p>I was, however, inspired by some of the famous software developers such as Bill Gates and Elon Musk that
            had created something the world wanted and used.</p>
          <p>So I set out to build something I thought the world needed. An events platform that would change how we
            discover and engage with up-coming events. Think of Eventbrite crossed with Instagram and you will be close
            to what I had in mind.</p>

          <p>You can see some screenshots of the app below. For no other reason than I thought it was a cool name, I
            called the website and app Onit. To this day I still cringe even just saying the name ...</p>

        <p>I wasn't alone in this endeavor. I hired some inexperienced software developers and personally mentored and
          trained them. In doing so I discovered I had a real talent for teaching and making things easy to understand.
          They eventually became great software engineers.</p>

        <h3>My First Major Product Launch Was A Disaster!</h3>
        <p>The sofware worked well. Both website and app had a great user interface, nicely designed and was simple to
          use. Being one of the best software developers in the UK I expected nothing less. <b>The problem was, no one
            wanted to use it!</b></p>

        <p>I had made three of the biggest mistakes a Startup could make.
          <li>Firstly I had designed and developed something for myself assuming that lots of other people would want it
            too. </li>
          <li>Secondly I had not tested the market to see if there was a demand.</li>
          <li>Third, I knew nothing about marketing.</li>

        </p>
        <p>I had spent so much time focusing on becoming the best software engineer I could that it never occured to me
          that I needed to learn anything about marketing.</p>
        <p>I had the "if you build it they will come" mentality. If I ever find the person that made me believe this
          nonsense I will beat him to a pulp!</p>
        <p>Up until now <b>I had spent over $150,000 dollars on developing this software!</b> Most of this money was
          spent on paying employees but I had also been renting office space, buying computer and office equipment,
          paying utility bills, paying accountancy fees and even local area office tax.</p>
        <p>With no one using the app or website there was literally no way to recoup this money!</p>

        <p>Persaverance being one of my personality traits I wasn't giving up that easily.</p>
        <p>I believed if I could just market the app people would want to use it for sure. So I devised all sorts of
          clever marketing tactics to build brand awareness and get people to download it.

        <p>One product is a fitness app called <b>Fit In 5</b> that myself and my business partner Marvin launched

          When I first started putting websites together I knew nothing about SEO. I can't stress how important SEO is to making your business look credible and getting your products and services sold. Just try telling someone about your business and having them Google it only not to find it listed on the first page. They will think you don't really exist!
        </p>
        <p>

          I've put some of my most effective ranking secrets into this Quick Start guide which will allow you to rank at the top of Google fast! It's key learnings and action items about SEO packed into a <b>simple, easy</b> to use guide for you to get your startup <u>out ranking and out selling your competitors</u>&nbsp;!... <b>(even if you've never built a website before!)</b>

        <h3>Leverage Over 15 Years Of Research, Testing, And Development To Get More Traffic, More
          Leads, And More Sales</h3>
        <p>If you’re like most entrepreneurs I’ve worked with you probably don’t have time to
          be learning several different traffic strategies…</p>
        <p>You need to be effective and efficient with your marketing. You want to use your
          valuable time and energy on a strategy that will actually work without having to rely on mind numbing trial
          and error.</p>
        <br />
        <div class="one-half column value">
          <p class="value-description">When you register for The Traffic Intensive, you’ll get to leverage over 15 years
            of my experience and the millions of dollars I’ve spent testing what works –– and literally cut your learning
            curve down by half.</p>
          <p class="value-description">This system is proven to work so you can feel confident knowing that you’re
            following a strategy that will get you results. <strong>In fact I guarantee it.</strong></p>
            <p class="value-description">What I’m going to be teaching you has proven to work for me time and time again,
              and will continue to work long into the future.</p>
            <p class="value-description">That’s because everything I’ll be teaching you is based on human psychology which
              hasn’t changed for 1000s of years.</p>
            <p class="value-description">So unless there is a major evolutionary shift in the way people are wired, you
              won’t need to worry about this system going ‘out of date’. The skills you learn in this program will pay
              dividends for the rest of your business career.</p>

            While these techniques can make you money without minimum capital outlay, it is NOT an
            employment opportunity or a get rich quick scheme.

            It is NOT a way to amass a large amount of wealth without working hard.

            And it is NOT a chance to join some kind of network that will do all the hard work for you.

            Most people who take part in this bootcamp get the “how to” but never take action with the information. I’m only
            sharing what has worked for me and my students.

            Your results are dependent on many factors… including but not limited to your ability to work hard, commit
            yourself, and do whatever it takes.

            If you're not willing to accept that, please DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS BOOTCAMP.

            But… If you’re ready…
