          No matter what your passion, hobby, or skill is… Software Bootcamp will give you a simple guide to get your
          software business up and running fast and turn your software development skills into a profitable side-hustle
          by doing something you actually enjoy.

            Successful software developers are not the ones you work with. Let's face it. They argue about which
            software design pattern to use, they complain about how the codebase needs refactoring and that the current
            architecture isn't clean enough. They want SOLID principles through the code base but forget what really
            counts. Having a SOLID bank account that allows you to enjoy life. Successful developers make money online
            and then travel the world without worrying about paying the bills or where their next paycheck is going to
            come from.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Using the Startup Bootcamp, you’ll be able to create a super easy side-hustle that only takes a few hours a
            week to work on. Or if you so choose, you can spend a little more time on it and turn it into your own
            profit generating asset!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Whether you have just landed your first graduate role in software development, or someone who has a ton of
            experience coding, or if you’re someone who hasn't written a line of code yet but you are able to think
            logically…
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Startup Bootcamp will give you insight into what’s working NOW to get an online business up and running fast
            and get handsomely rewarded by using your development skills!

          Here’s A Weird But True Fact:
          People Who Are Less Adept At Software Development, Actually Find It Easier To Make Money Online! </h3>

        <p>
          The best way to find success making money online is not to focus on your coding. You have this skillset down
          already! Instead you need to focus on the thing that matters the most. Marketing!
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>
            It doesn't matter if you know nothing about marketing or making money. You didn't know the first thing about
            coding when you first started right? But look how far you've come </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            You probably know a person or you’ve heard of a person who may not be the best software developer but they
            have made a ton of money online. Heck just go to Youtube. You'll see dozens of young kids that have becomes
            super successful. Why is that? </p>

            No, it’s simply because they tried. They didn't let the fear of not knowing what to do or not having the
            correct skillset to make it work hold them back. They just wanted to achive something so they put effort
            into it </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            You see our world is built on connection. It's a necessity to connect for survival, for friendship, for
            love, for growth and to make money. But as software developers we tend to feel more comfortable being
            introverted. We are afraid to put ourselves out there. We hold ourselves back. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Here is what Mark Zuckerberg had to say about connection.
        </div>


      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <strong>
          “When I was building Facebook I was just trying to help connect people… you couldn’t find and connect with the
          people that you cared about, which as people is actually the most important thing.”
        </strong>

      <div class="col-10">
        <p>
          <br />
          Connecting with people is how we offer our products and services. They value and want our services. But we
          need to connect with them to deliver and in return get paid. This is all marketing really is. <b>Marketing is
            the science of connecting with people</b>.

              When I first started putting websites together I knew nothing about SEO. I can't stress how important SEO
              is to making your business look credible and getting your products and services sold. Just try telling
              someone about your business and having them Google it only not to find it listed on the first page. They
              will think you don't really exist!
            </p>
            <p>

              I've put some of my most effective ranking secrets into this Quick Start guide which will allow you to
              rank at the top of Google fast! It's key learnings and action items about SEO packed into a <b>simple,
                easy</b> to use guide for you to get your startup <u>out ranking and out selling your

            While these techniques can make you money without minimum capital outlay, it is NOT an
            employment opportunity or a get rich quick scheme.

            It is NOT a way to amass a large amount of wealth without working hard.

            And it is NOT a chance to join some kind of network that will do all the hard work for you.

            Most people who take part in this bootcamp get the “how to” but never take action with the information. I’m
            only
            sharing what has worked for me and my students.

            Your results are dependent on many factors… including but not limited to your ability to work hard, commit
            yourself, and do whatever it takes.

            If you're not willing to accept that, please DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS BOOTCAMP.

            But… If you’re ready…
